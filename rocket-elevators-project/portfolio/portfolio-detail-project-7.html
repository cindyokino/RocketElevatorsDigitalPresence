					<h4>Modernizations</h4>
					Improving energy conservation was the goal of the World Financial Center’s modernization project. A total of 96 elevators were updated as part of a $250 million renovation endeavor. Rocket Elevators modernizations achieve the largest potential for efficiency by reducing the energy used to operate the elevators.

					<h4>Reduce time</h4>
					The project also marks the first large-scale modernization in the region to feature thyssenkrupp Elevator’s Destination Dispatch, which directs passengers to the elevator that will get them to their destination in the shortest travel time. This practice can reduce time to destination by up to 30% compared to standard elevator control.
