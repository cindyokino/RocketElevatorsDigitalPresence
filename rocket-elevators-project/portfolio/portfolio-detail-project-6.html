					<h4>Monumental</h4>
					The monumental One World Trade Center project has become one of the most significant structures to be conceived – and Rocket Elevators is proud to be a part of it. Servicing the Observation Deck, high-rise express elevators will be the fastest in North America and will travel up to 2,000 feet per minute (approximately 23 miles per hour). It will take approximately one minute on an express elevator to ride from the bottom to the 102nd floor.

					<h4>Safety</h4>
					Obviously, safety is the top priority for the project. To that end, the elevators have the capacity to transport approximately 12% of the building’s occupants in a five-minute period. And the project includes a dedicated firefighters’ service car, equipped with side openings throughout the building to provide exclusive access to a dedicated firefighters’ stairwell.

					<h4>73 Elevators</h4>
					In total, there are 73 elevators and 11 escalators for the 104- story building, with a total height of 1,776 feet. For 58 of the passenger elevators, Destination Dispatch will direct passengers to the elevator that will get them to their destination with the shortest travel time and help ensure building security.
