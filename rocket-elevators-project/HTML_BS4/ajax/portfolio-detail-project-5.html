					<h4>Slope</h4>
					GG House is located in Krakow, Poland on a steep, south slope. It was designed by Architeckt Tadeusz Lemanski to rise up from the slope on four columns that support not just the home but also a cantilevered terrace. With the garage on the lowest level and the social zone two flights up, the architects also designed GG House to include a vertical glass tunnel to house an elevator for easy access to all the volumes.

					<h4>Elevator</h4>
					The elevator connects both the private and social volumes with the garage below, but access to the garage is hidden as the vertical glass tunnel disappears into the landscape. The various terraces on the homeâ€™s facade are all interconnected due to an innovative design that uses a continuous geo-style framework of decks and privacy walls.

					<h4>Panoramic view</h4>
					Entrance to the home is through an unobtrusive door to the left of the garage which leads to the elevator. There is another door which leads to the social zone above, accessed via the long flight of stairs on the side of the building. With the elevator completely clad in glazings, the panoramic views of the distant River Vistula are visible from the side terrace. The elevator opens to a second enclosed terrace on the side of the home. The living room overlooks this terrace via the row of square windows.
