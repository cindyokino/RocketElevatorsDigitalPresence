					<h4>Adventure</h4>
					In China, on the territory of one of the most scenic nature reserves, located in the district of Wulingyuan, is the unique Bailong Elevator. The elevator was mounted next to one of the mountain masses. It raises the visitors of the nature reserve to the viewing platform, which is equipped at the height of 360 meters. The elevator has the two-storey cabin and can transport up to 50 people uniquely. The main feature of the elevator is the transparent walls and the glass floor. The ride with Bailong is a truly stunning adventure.

					<h4>18 million dollars</h4>
					To check your own courage while driving, you can just look under the legs. The fast-moving earth provides the unforgettable impressions. The speed of the elevator is 3 m / s, so the passengers have enough time to enjoy the beautiful panorama of the surroundings. Bailong is not just an ordinary elevator, but a complex of three cabins that move parallel to each other. The construction of the elevator began in 1999 and lasted only three years. The investment in the project amounted to about 18 million

					<h4>Earthquake sensors</h4>
					Since the territory of the nature conservation area will be considered an earthquake hazard area, the elevator system was supplemented with earthquake sensors. In case of danger, all three elevators should evacuate all people from the viewing platform. Bailong was entered into the Guinness Book of Records. <strong>It is the highest lift on the earth, from whose cabin the open overview opens. Moreover, Bailong is the tallest and the most powerful elevator in the world.</strong> Although the elevator construction was strongly criticized by the ecologists, it has been one of the main attractions of the nature reserve for more than ten years.
