					<h4>Unusual</h4>
					At the first sight of the Falkirk Wheel, one can hardly suspect that this complicated construction of the unusual shape and the impressive size is an ordinary lift. Actually, Falkirk Wheel is a unique rotatable ship lift that connects two canals - Union and Forth Clyde. The height difference between these channels is 24 meters, so the original revolving elevator was an ideal means for their connection.

					<h4>Impressively large</h4>
					Although you can hardly drive with this unusual lift, its visit is recommended for all the trailers of the unusual excursions. As mentioned above, the elevator is impressively large. Its diameter is 35 meters. The central axis has the length of 100 meters and consists of two individual elements, the shape of which resembles the typical Celtic ax.

					<h4>Rotating elevator</h4>
					Falkirk Wheel looks very impressive. During operation, quiet and slow movements of the rotating 'elevator' look simply magical. The ship lift was opened in 2002. The Queen Elisabeth II participated in the solemn opening ceremony. Just a year later the unusual building was awarded with a number of prizes. The lift design was declared one of the best design projects in 2002. The full workflow of the elevator takes about 4 minutes. On the coasts of the canals grow the beautiful meadows, which in the summer are covered with the lush green grass and are the favorite tourist destination of tourists.
